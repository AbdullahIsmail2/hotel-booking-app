Topics included:
--> Setting up basic express.js application
--> What is nodemon

The following code is how we set up a basic express.js application

import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import "dotenv/config";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(cors())


Breakdown of some important lines:

const app = express()
--> This creates an instance of an Express application
--> 'app' is what will be used to define routes, middleware and other configurations

app.use(express.json())
--> This middleware function is used to parse incoming requests
--> It automatically parses JSON data from the request body and makes it available under 'req.body'
--> If app.use(express.json()) was to be left out, req.body would be undefined if you did not manually parse the data


app.use(cors())
--> CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
--> app.use(cors()) enables our application to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
--> This allows your server to accept requests from different domains
--> This is essential for APIs that would be consumed by applications hosted on different origins 



///// Nodemon

Nodemon is a development tool for Node.js applications that automaticall automatically restarts the server whenever changes are detected in the source files

Its useful during development for improving efficiency and productivity
